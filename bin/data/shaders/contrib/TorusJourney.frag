    Biomine
    -------
    
    A biocooling system for a futuristic, off-world mine... or a feeding mechanisn for an alien 
	hatchery? I wasn't really sure what I was creating when I started, and I'm still not. :) I at 
	least wanted to create the sense that the tubes were pumping some form of biomatter around 
	without having to resort to full reflective and refractive passes... I kind of got there. :)

	All things considered, there's not a lot to this. Combine a couple of gyroid surfaces, ID them,
	then add their respective material properties. The scene is simple to create, and explained in
	the distance function. There's also some function based, 2nd order cellular bump mapping, for 
	anyone interested.

	The fluid pumped through the tubes was created by indexing the reflected and refracted rays 
	into a basic environment mapping function. Not accurate, but simple, effective and way cheaper
	than the real thing.

	I'd just finished watching some of the Assembly 2016 entries on YouTube, so for better or
	worse, wanted to produce the scene without the help of any in-house textures.
